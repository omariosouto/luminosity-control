# ng-materialize

A custom build of [Materialize][materialize] featuring native [AngularJS][angular] components.

## About

ng-materialize is a custom build of the Materialize framework that includes native AngularJS components. The directives favor simplicity over customization, and aim to adhere to a strict interpretation of Google's Material Design. The project removes Materialize's jQuery, Velocity.js and custom JavaScript dependencies, but requires ngAnimate and Waves (one of Materialize's hidden dependencies).
